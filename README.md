# terminal_website
A simple terminal website from scratch with HTML, CSS and Vanilla-js.

The context of this project is a local 3hrs code-contest

The terminal is draggable which i achieved with some basic position functions.
A tree data structure is implemented to hold the folder structure.
The following commands are available:


* man - displays all the commands (from linux)
* start/whoami - they don't do that much.
* cd - navigates around folders (from linux and windows)
* ls - shows directories in the current one (from linux)
* exit - (intended to close the website, but doesn't due to unfixed restriction from the browser)
* pwd - shows the actual directory
* mkdir - makes a directory. (The directory is temporal. I probably could have edited the .js file `FolderStructure` to make them kind of permanent)
